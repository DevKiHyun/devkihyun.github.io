I do research in signal processing and sometimes do research in computer vision processing. 

As an undergraduate study, I mainly studied the anomaly detection problem for mechanical sound.

In company, I has researched deep learning models for speech signal processing, focusing on speech recognition.

I am interested in speech models, generative models and representation learning.
